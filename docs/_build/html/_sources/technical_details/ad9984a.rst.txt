Analog Devices AD9984A
======================

The Analog Devices AD9984A is an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) specialised for video
digitisation. Full details, including the datasheet, can be found on the `Analog Devices AD9984A
product page <https://www.analog.com/en/products/ad9984a.html>`_.

The specific part is the AD9984AKSTZ-140, an LQFP-packaged part supporting a maximum pixel clock of
140MHz.

The key points of the integration of this IC into the design are:

* An external pixel clock (derived from the Amiga's colour clock) is always used.
* The device supports two sets of inputs (RGB+sync); only input set 0 is used in this design.


Power supply and voltages
-------------------------

The AD9984A requires four power inputs:

* |V_D|, 1.8V. This is the **main power supply**. From the datasheet: These pins supply power to
  the main elements of the circuit. They should be as quiet and as filtered as possible.
* |V_DD|, 1.8 - 3.3V. This is the **digital output power supply**. From the datasheet: A large number of
  output pins (up to 35) switching at high speed (up to 170 MHz) generates large amounts of power
  supply transients (noise). These supply pins are identified separately from the |V_D| pins. As a
  result, special care must be taken to minimize output noise transferred into the sensitive analog
  circuitry. If the AD9984A is interfacing with lower voltage logic, |V_DD| can be connected to a
  lower supply voltage (as low as 1.8 V) for compatibility.
* |PV_D|, 1.8V. This is the **PLL power supply**. From the datasheet: The most sensitive portion
  of the AD9984A is the clock generation circuitry. These pins provide power to the clock PLL and
  help the user design for optimal performance. The designer should provide quiet, noise-free power
  to these pins.
* |DAV_DD|, 1.8V. This is the **digital input power supply**. From the datasheet: This supplies
  power to the digital logic. It is recommended to connect this pin to the |V_D| supply.

The FPGA module's GPIO pins all use the 3.3V I/O standard, therefore, |V_DD| will be connected to
the 3.3V supply from the FPGA module. There is the recommendation to connect |V_D| and |DAV_DD| to
the same 1.8V supply. |PV_D| is also 1.8V and we will connect this to the same supply on the
assumption (yet to be tested) that this will be adequate (after all, we will not be using the PLL
in this design). To get a 1.8V supply, the simplest solution will be a basic voltage divider of the
3.3V supply from the FPGA module.

Digital inputs can tolerate up to 5V. This means that the Amiga's HSYNC and VSYNC can be connected
directly, if required.


Input pins
----------

The following inputs are used (with reference to Table 4 in the datasheet):

* R\ :sub:`AIN0`, G\ :sub:`AIN0`, B\ :sub:`AIN0` - analog red, green and blue signals from the
  Amiga. Note that these must be terminated and coupled according to Figure 4 of the datasheet.
* HSYNC0 and VSYNC0 - these are connected to the Amiga's HSYNC and VSYNC. These do not need
  termination, although TBD if buffering is appropriate (in the current design they are connected
  directly).
* EXTCK - this is connected to the PLL output and represents the Amiga's pixel clock.
* PWRDN - TBC

The following inputs are not used in this design:

* R\ :sub:`AIN1`, G\ :sub:`AIN1`, B\ :sub:`AIN1`
* HSYNC1 and VSYNC1
* SOGIN0 and SOGIN1 - not used and left unconnected in accordance with the datasheet.
* CLAMP - not used and left unconnected in accordance with the datasheet.
* COAST - this shares a pin with EXTCK. The COAST function of the pin is ignored.


Reference pins
--------------

* REFLO and REFHI must be connected to each other with a 10ÂµF capacitor, as shown in Figure 6 of
  the datasheet.
* FILT is required for the best stability of the AD9984A's internal PLL. We do not use the internal
  PLL, but the datasheet is not clear if this means the circuit to do this is optional. Since the
  required circuit is simple (see Figure 8 in the datasheet), we implement it for completeness and
  to allow the option of using the internal PLL in future.


Control pins
------------

SDA and SCL are standard I\ :sup:`2`\ C pins, which are passed through to the FPGA module directly.
